    <p>Almost 20 percent of Americans, or more than 40 million adults, can't 
    afford or access needed health care, according to a new U.S. government report released Monday.</p>

        <p>A recent study found that lack of insurance coverage can be tied to 45,000 deaths per year in the 
            United States and that people without health insurance have a 
            40% higher risk of death than those with private health insurance.</p>

            <p>Health care in the United States is expensive. Insanely, outlandishly expensive.We spend 
                $2.8 trillion on health care annually. That works out to about one-sixth of the
                     total economy and more than $8,500 per person â€” and way more than any other country.</p>

                <p>Although many of these statistics are less than encouraging, one of the best ways to improve the overall 
                    health and wellness of the population and avoid preventable deaths is 
                    to get more people insured so they can get the health care they need. </p>
